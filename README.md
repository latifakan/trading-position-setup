# Trading App

This trading app will allow you to easily calculate your fees and position size to enter a trade.

Simply put in these information:

- Your entry price and stop loss price
- Your maker and taker fees of your exchange
- Your amount you want to risk (in $)

You'll get a calculation of your fees and the total cost of the trade. That includes your risk + your fees.
You'll also get a calculated position size, which you have to use to get to the amount you want to risk in a trade.
